Take a peek at what we have built today so far.

<!--more-->

We have developed the main website, built with Hugo and deployed to GitHub Pages, the source code is available on our GitHub.

The main website still need to do a lot of content editing, however, we decided to publish the website so we can pressure ourselve into working harder.

#### In-game changes:

Last week we have add/remove many changes to the game server. Some mods were add, some were removed.

Here are some significant changes to the game:
* The weather temperature now usually sub-zero, *you got Frostline experience without DLC, xD*.
* You can build any fcking where in the server except trader zones and some reserved safe zones.
* The market system, central economy is under heavy adjustment to balance the entire server.

Hopefull in the next weekend we can roll out the next update. See you in Chernarus!

The DZVN Team.
